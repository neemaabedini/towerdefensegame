/**
 * Pre-level mutator definitions (CD-30 meta-progression, design doc
 * docs/design-meta-progression.md §5 Q3). Same loader pattern as
 * perks.ts. Two v1 mechanisms (design doc option C), registry-dispatched by
 * field presence — a def can carry either, both, or neither:
 * - `wave`: pure-data transform applied to a DEEP COPY of `level.waves` at
 *   `loadLevel` (`Game.buildRunWaves`). Deterministic, no sim change — the
 *   non-stat difficulty dial (M9) so mutators are never the only knob.
 * - `mods`: a player-side debuff folded into the same `globalStatMods`
 *   merge perks use (`Game.computeLoadoutMods`) — reuses B2, no parallel
 *   math.
 * `enemyMods` (Hardened Foe) is a third, narrower seam: one multiply at
 * `Game.spawnEnemy`, shipped only because it landed as a clean one-liner
 * (design doc §7 Slice 3 note — otherwise it would have been deferred).
 * `restrict` (Pact-style restriction mutators) and `scoreMult` (a future
 * score layer) are named-but-unbuilt seams (design doc Extension seams
 * 3/7) — no v1 def sets either.
 *
 * A win with >=1 mutator active writes `levels[id].mutatorWin = true`
 * (`AppShell.recordVictory`), lighting Star 3. Selected mutators are
 * SESSION-ONLY (design doc §11's recommendation) — `AppShell` keeps them in
 * an in-memory field, never `settings`, so they reset on reload while
 * perks persist.
 *
 * NAMING: every `name` below is a design-doc PLACEHOLDER (§11) — not yet
 * signed off. Do not treat these as final.
